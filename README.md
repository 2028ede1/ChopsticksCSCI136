# CSCI 136 - FINAL PROJECT - CHOPSTICKS w/ Minimax AI
By Emmanuel Ekpenyong and John Walden, in Prof. Katie Keith's CSCI 136 class, Spring 2025

# Overview

A Java implementation of the two-player hand game Chopsticks, where the goal is to eliminate all of your opponent's hands by causing them to reach a total of five fingers on each hand. The AI selects optimal moves using Minimax decision logic. We implemented a custom Minimax tree data structure—combining elements of a k-ary tree—which we learned independently and built from scratch. The game is interactive, using drag-and-drop controls for player moves. All graphics were created using the Java Swing graphics library along with other standard Java AWT component libraries.

# To Use

2. navigate into the ChopsticksCSCI136 directory and type
   * javac -d bin Chopsticks/*.java (to compile)
   * java -cp bin Chopsticks.Chopsticks (to run the game)
